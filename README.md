see prev editions:

- Red dragon book - 1st edition

## preamble this book 
does not assume that you know the books before it does also not contain all the stuff mentioned in the first 2 editions this aims to show you how compilers work today while some times jumpting back to content in the prev books but not as often as we work today most of the time with distributed Applications.
The Compiler Principles did not change but the way to apply them and the tools to use them did change with the Virtual Machine research and todays CPU Capacitys of Cycles and gigaflops. That leaded to a new eara the one of Virtual Machines which are in fact at the core always Compilers you can see it all over while you maybe did never pay attention to the fact that for example the stack that this new shiny none needed lang Rust Lang uses is called Cranelift Compiler and that compiler is implemented based on LLVM Low Level Virtual Machine or you see it with languages like go which are also using a vm or dart also vm ECMAScript the language of choice for our scripting needs as it got some compiler features and integrations that the others do not fully have.

You will dive into the magical virtual worlds where dragons are history we will beat the dragon finaly first there was assembly and we saw that it was good then there where compilers and we saw they are good then there came more and more devices we invented virtual machines and saw they are good. Thats where we are. All now gets converted from complex to simple via composition out of simple.
